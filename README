- I compared different regressor models: SVR, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor to analyze which model has the prediction power considering the 'Position_Salaries.csv'
- I did not applied any tuning hyperparameters, it's using the default parameters. The intention is to analyze the 'raw performance' of each algorithm
- For SVR model was applied FeatureScaling to standardize the data

Results:
1st: SVR
2st: RandomForestRegressor
3st: DecisioNTreeRegressor
